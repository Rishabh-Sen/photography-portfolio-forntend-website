<p id="sect1-p1-about">About</p>

<p  id="sect1-p2-about">I am a 20 years old self-taught photographer based in ODISHA. An avid learner, my thirst for something more than paints and canvases landed me in the field of photography and I started clicking frames instead of painting them. The journey of gradual learning and exploring through this new fascination of mine which started in my 1st year of graduation And still continues. I click a varied number of subjects which include landscapes, portraits, festivals, Streets, Moody, etc. I am Pursuing Bachelor Degree in Agriculture from Lovely Professional University. I am currently seeking a satisfying career where I can utilizes my creativity, personal skills and interest and direct them towards success of an organisation. Whatever I See, I shoot. I am just a Learner in Street and Travel photography. I find interesting in observing expressions and creating stories through Picture. Street Photography is providing you freedom to take any kind of shots because we need to show stories through pictures. Sometimes, if youâ€™re too focused on one thing, you will miss everything else around you.  When People Ask Me What Equipments I Used To Take Clicks Simply My Answer Is "Eyes". </p>
